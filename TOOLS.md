## UnPacking

### De4Dot
***Web:*** https://github.com/de4dot/de4dot <br/>
***Developer:*** de4dot <br/>
***Description:*** de4dot is an open source .NET deobfuscator and unpacker written in C#. It will try its best to restore a packed and obfuscated assembly to almost the original assembly.
Most of the obfuscation can be completely restored (eg. string encryption), but symbol renaming is impossible to restore since the original names aren't (usually) part of the obfuscated assembly.<br/>

### GUnPacker *Available using the extra called: Oldies*
***Web:*** Unknown <br/>
***Developer:*** Unknown <br/>
***Description:*** This tool is a generic unpacker. It has two main functionalities: (A) OEP positioning, and (B) the dumped code and data can be used to repair the follow-up of a PE header.
From Chinese developers. Competitor of Quick Unpack. <br/>

### NETUnpack *Available using the extra called: Oldies*
***Web:*** https://ntcore.com/?page_id=353 <br/>
***Developer:*** Erik Pistelli (NTCore) <br/>
***Description:*** This is a program to dump .NET packed applications. Of course no serious .NET protection relies on packing. In fact, this software shows how easily you can unpack a protected assemly. <br/>

### QUnpack
***Web:*** http://qunpack.ahteam.org <br/>
***Developer:*** Archer & FEUERRADER <br/>
***Description:*** The program is intended for a dynamic unpacking of binders, crypters, packers and protectors.
QuickUnpack tries to bypass all possible scramblers/obfuscators and restores redirected import. From the version 1 the opportunity of unpacking dll is added. From the version 2 the attach process feature added which allows to use QuickUnpack as a dumper and import recoverer. Scripts are also supported from version 2 which allows unpacking of more complicated protections. Version 3 brought x64 support and hardware virtualization debugging engine. This makes QuickUnpack a unique software product which has no similar analogues in the world! <br/>

### RL!dePacker (with unpack SDK) *Available using the extra called: Oldies*
***Web:*** http://www.reversinglabs.com <br/>
***Developer:*** Ap0x <br/>
***Description:*** Reversing Labs RL!dePacker has a build in option to detect OEP. However this option does not work with VB (always use FindOEP! function with VB applications and Force to manual OEP?) and some packers. So if RL!dePacker can not unpack the file use FindOEP! function to detect correct OEP, but use it only as a second resort since it can be jammed! <br/>
Generic unpacker can unpack ONLY packers that do not use IAT redirection, that don’t steal APIs and which fill out IAT table in correct order. All ordinals that can be converted to API names are converted, others are inserted into IAT as ordinals! <br/>

### UniExtract 2
